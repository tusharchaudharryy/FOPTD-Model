# FOPTD-Model
1. Developed a comprehensive dynamic model for bioreactor systems using material balances for biomass, substrate, and product concentrations.

2. Incorporated substrate and product inhibition effects into the growth rate kinetics using an advanced Monod equation.

3. Conducted steady-state and dynamic simulations using MATLAB's ODE solvers (e.g., ODE45) to evaluate system behavior under varying conditions.

4. Simulated step changes in dilution rate and feed substrate concentration, providing insights into the transient system response.

5. Identified First-Order Plus Time Delay (FOPTD) model parameters, including process gain (Kp), time constant (τp), and deadtime (θp).

6. Validated the FOPTD model using training and testing datasets, demonstrating accurate prediction of system responses to step changes.
